# Credit Risk Probability Model Using Alternative Data

## Final Project Report

### Executive Summary

This project developed an innovative credit risk assessment model for Bati Bank utilizing alternative data sources from an eCommerce platform. The model addresses the critical challenge of evaluating customer creditworthiness for individuals lacking traditional credit history. By leveraging transaction patterns and customer behavior data, we've created a robust system that makes financial services more accessible to underserved populations while maintaining strong risk management practices.
